# Pirates Number
## _Sea of Thieves gold, doublons and sinked boats counter_

Pirates Number is a software written in python which, thanks to an OCR tool for python ([pytesseract]), allows you to identify how much gold and how many doubloons you have and tell you how much you have earned from the previous check, very useful if you are interested in knowing exactly how much gold you have earned in the current game session for example.<br>
Inside the software there is also a function that allows you to count how many boats have been sunk, this data is also saved in a text file, thus allowing it to be saved even if the software is restarted.

## Installation and frist configuration
The frist thing to do to use this software is to download it and extract all the file from the zip in a directory, after this you need to do the frist configuration. 
### Frist configuration
To configure the softer the frist time you use it 

## Known problems
#### Overlapping numbers

#### Credits button exits the screen


## Future Development

##### Complete rewrite of the code

##### Remove knwon problems

##### Add more presets

## Tech

Pirates number uses a lot of library to work properly:
- [pytesseract] - Recognize and “read” the text embedded in images
- [Pillow] - Image processing
- [keyboard] - register hotkeys
- [tkinter] - GUI toolkit
- [time] - Time-related functions
- [os] - Use operating system dependent functionality
- [datetime] - Manipulate dates
- [glob] - Unix style pathname pattern expansion
- [inspect] - Inspect live objects
- [re] - Regular expression operations
- [functiontools] - Higher-order functions and operations on callable objects
- [tkinter.font] - Tkinter font wrapper
- [webbrowser] - Open link
